		<h3>1859 Robjohn (II/11)</h3>
			This is the only surviving work of Thomas Robjohn (New York). The walnut case, entirely veneered in rosewood, is perhaps its most notable feature. Several organists enjoyed playing it at our open house. It has a lovely sound. See <a href="/opus/37-stop-list">specs</a> and <a href="/opus/37-specs">more photos</a> on the <a href="/opus/37-specs">Opus 37 page</a>.

		<h3>ca. 1900 Cramer</h3>
		<img src="/images/Cramer-news.jpg"><BR>
This <strong>two-manual reed organ </strong>is certainly a rarity today. It has been thoroughly overhauled, including replacing missing or broken reeds. The sound of the full chorus (16-8-4) is rich indeed.
